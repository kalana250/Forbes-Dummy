   magazine subscriptions, and our digital Services like Forbes.com, Forbes mobile applications,

           <h1> WHAT OUR PRIVACY STATEMENT COVERS</h1>

           <p>
This Privacy Statement applies only to user information collected or created by us or shared with us in relation 
to our Properties or Services. While you may encounter links on the Properties to other websites, such as those 
relating to our third-party sponsors, advertisers, and other partners (e.g., our affiliate network operators), 
including when you sign into Forbes.com using a social media or digital wallet service, please note that these
 websites are not covered by this Privacy Statement (unless otherwise noted on such site, which may be the case
  if, for example, the site is also owned and operated by Forbes).</p>

<p>We may provide different or additional privacy notices in connection with certain activities, programs, and
     offerings (for example, if you submit a job application through the Properties). Additionally, we may provide
      additional "just-in-time" notices or notices at collection that may supplement or clarify our privacy practices
       or provide you with additional choices regarding your personal information.</p>

<p>This Privacy Statement does not apply to the activities of Forbes' third-party sponsors, advertisers, and other 
    partners (e.g., our affiliate network operators) that may collect your personal information while you access or
     use such third party's services in connection with your use of our Properties (e.g., social media and sharing 
     services, digital wallet logins, widgets, and/or interactive mini-programs that run on the Properties). This Privacy
      Statement also does not apply to Forbes' third-party licensees, who manage and run their own Forbes-branded services 
      and sites, some of whom the Properties link out to. The privacy and information practices of those third parties are
       not covered by this Privacy Statement. To learn more about the policies of such third parties, we encourage you to 
       read and review the privacy statements of each third-party service that you may choose to use.</p>

<p>We offer widgets that are hosted on the Properties, such as our embeddable video player. Use of the Forbes.com widgets
     is subject to our Site's Terms of Use, but downloading or embedding these widgets on other websites is not covered
      by this Privacy Statement.</p>

<h3>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU</h3>

<p>We use the term "personal information" – also called "personal data" or "personally identifiable information" in the laws of 
some jurisdictions – to refer to information that reasonably identifies, relates to, describes, or can be associated with you.
 The following are categories and types of personal information that we may collect from or about you, depending on how you</p>


<h3>  interact with the Properties:</h3>

<ul type="disc">

<li>Identifiers, such as your name and email address;</li><br>

<li> information, such as your mailing address and telephone number;</li><br>

If you interact with us on social media or use features such as plugins, widgets, or other tools made available by 
social media platforms or networks in connection with our Properties, or if you choose to sign up for a paid subscription
 via your social media profile, we may collect information that you share with us on social media or that such platforms
  share with us. Please review the privacy policies and settings of the social media platforms and networks that you use
   for more information about their privacy practices. For additional information, see the section titled Third-Party Sources 
   below.

If you choose to log into one of our Properties using a digital wallet, we may collect public data points such as your wallet
 address, the blockchain your wallet is on, your wallet's transactions and transaction history, and whether your wallet holds
  a Forbes digital collectable.

Where you sign-up for paid subscriptions as a gift option (e.g., on behalf of a friend or colleague, the gift recipient),
 you may provide us with personal information on behalf of the gift recipient.</p>

<h3>HOW WE COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>



<h4>Personal Information You Provide</h4>

<p>We collect personal information that you provide to us directly. This may include, but is not limited to, information you provide:</p>

<ul type="disc">

    <li>Identifiers, such as your name and email address;</li><br>
    
    <li> information, such as your mailing address and telephone number;</li><br>
    
    <li> information, such as credit or debit card information;</li><br>

    <li> information, such as your mailing address and telephone number;</li><br>
    
    <li> information, such as credit or debit card information;</li>

     you can still access and use portions of the Properties, but you may be unable to access certain options and services, such 
     as paid subscription content. If you wish to provide user information to us about a third party, such your friend or colleague,
      in connection with a referral, gift subscription, corporate subscription, recommendation, nomination (e.g., Under 30 list
       nomination), or other purpose, please only do so if you have the permission of that third party. When you register or
        become a member of the Site or provide information to Forbes in any other manner, you agree to provide only true, accurate, 
        current and complete information.</p>

<h3>Personal Information We Collect Automatically</h3>


<p>When you visit our Properties, open or click on emails we send you, or interact with our advertisements or games, we or third
     parties we work with may automatically collect certain information using technologies such as cookies and other tracking
      technologies described below.

<h4>Cookies and Similar Technology</h4>

<p>

"Cookies" are pieces of information that may be placed on your device by a website for the purpose of collecting data to
 facilitate and enhance your communication and interaction with that website. Such data may include, for example, the
  address of the websites you visited before and after you visited our Properties, the type of browser you are using,
   your Internet Protocol (IP) address, what pages in the Properties you visited and what links you clicked on, the region 
   where your device is located, and geographic information based on your IP data. We may store some information on your device
    or device hard drive as a cookie or similar type of file (such as clear gifs, pixels, web beacons, tags, and similar
     technologies that work on mobile devices) to collect data related to usage of the Properties. We may also use cookies
      to customize your visit to the Properties (including our emails) and for other purposes to make your visit more convenient
      or to enable us to enhance the Properties. </p>

<p>Cookies fall into the subcategories below:<br><br>

<u>Required (sometimes referred to as "Essential").</u> <br><br>Certain cookies are used for specific purposes that are essential to your secure
 use and navigation of the Properties so that we are able to provide you with the services you request. Without them, Forbes may
  not be able to provide core Property functions and features to you, and the Property would not operate as well as you or Forbes
   would like. For example, they enable core functions like carrying out network transmissions and enabling you to log in to our 
   systems. They also enable us to comply with legal obligations in regions with laws that apply to cookies, like by maintaining 
   your cookie consent choices in regions that require consent or, in opt-out regions, by preventing advertising-related or other
    optional digital trackers from being placed on your browser or device if you have opted out. These cookies collect and use
     information such as your server preferences, single-session data and corresponding identifier, web beacons and log files
      (detailed below), and other credential-related information. Required cookies cannot be switched off on our Properties.
<br><br>
<u>Functional.</u><br><br> Other cookies may be used to collect and process information about your preferences and similar choices in connection with the Properties in order to allow us to provide enhanced functionality, customization and personalization, such as by remembering your login information or other choices or by providing you with more personalized features (e.g., various local preference settings; which geographically-customized version of the Properties and related content you may prefer). Functional cookies include social media cookies, which collect information about your social media usage and other data you may have provided in connection with such usage (if you access the Site through a social media website or mobile application, you may have social media cookies). If you wish to modify or change your social media cookies, please visit and review the settings on your applicable social media account(s).
<br><br>


Analytics. uThese cookies allow us to better understand our users' actions and interests, for instance, by tracking clicks, 
visits, and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our Properties and services. This allows us to
 provide a high-quality experience by customizing our offerings and quickly identifying and fixing any issues that arise.
  For example, we might use analytics cookies to keep track of which pages are most popular, which method of linking between 
  pages is most effective, and to determine why some pages are receiving error messages.

Advertising. To help support the Properties and further tailor your experience, Forbes and its advertising partners 
(and/or their third-party analytics providers) may also use cookies on the Properties (including in emails) to personalize 
the content and advertisements you may be shown. Such advertisements use cookies to provide you targeted advertisements that 
may be more consistent with your interests than non-targeted advertisements. Certain Forbes advertising partners may also use 
cookies to monitor or track the performance of their advertising content, including native advertising content (e.g., BrandVoice),
 including how you interact with the advertising content, even in situations where the ad is displayed on another site. If you do
  not allow these trackers on our Properties, you may still receive advertisements, but you may receive less relevant advertising 
  or content.

In certain countries and U.S. states, you can opt out or set preferences regarding cookies using our cookie management tool when a 
device you utilize visits our Properties. You may also be able to set preferences related to certain interest-based advertisements 
and targeted ads by using tools provided by self-regulatory programs like the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) program at 
www.aboutads.info/consumers and the Network Advertising Initiative at http://optout.networkadvertising.org/. To learn how,
 please see the Your Choices section below.

The Properties' web and ad servers log information about a user's IP address, browser type, and the current URL

the user is requesting. This information is always provided by a user's browser and automatically logged by most websites. 
These log files are stored in a secure location and used for internal business purposes such as internal analysis of traffic
 patterns within our Properties.

<h3>Clickstream Data</h3>



As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each website you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as "clickstream data," can be collected and stored by a website's server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the website from which you linked to the Properties. We may collect and use clickstream data as a form of aggregate information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of our Properties, how visitors navigate throughout the Properties, and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors. This information will be used to improve our Properties.

Analytics

We may work with third-party vendors who use the technologies described in this section to conduct website analytics to help us track and understand how visitors use our Properties. One such provider is Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC ("Google"). Google Analytics uses cookies to help analyze how users use the Properties. The information generated by these cookies about your use (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Properties, compiling reports on activity for its staff, and providing other services relating to web page activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. You may refuse the use of such cookies by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser. By using the Properties and accepting cookies, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above. Please refer to the currently available opt-outs for Google Analytics by visiting https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.

Service Data

We may obtain Service Data from or on behalf of our clients and their vendors, which we process on behalf of our clients in accordance with our contracts with them.

Third-Party Sources

From time to time, we may collect personal information about you from third party sources (including data append services such as public or social graph data, data co-ops, or social media websites if you have chosen to log in or connect your social media with our Properties) which we will use for our business or commercial purposes (for example, in order to contact you and/or to better serve you with content or promotions). However, we will only use this information where these third parties either have your consent or are otherwise legally permitted or required to disclose your personal information to us. We may also collect publicly available information from third party sources. To the extent that such information constitutes personal information, we shall use such it in accordance with this Privacy Statement or as permitted by law.

When you sign into our Properties or purchase a paid subscription on our Properties using a social media log-in, you give permission to that social media company to share certain information with us. For example, if you sign in or purchase a subscription using Facebook or LinkedIn, you give permission to Facebook or LinkedIn (as applicable) to share with us your email address and certain other information in your social media profile that you have designated as public. This will be limited to your full name, age range, profile picture (if you have one) and link to your Facebook or LinkedIn profile (as applicable). If you log in or purchase a subscription using your Google account, you give Google permission to share personal information with us that you have made public in your Google profile. This will be limited to your full name, your email address (and whether your email has been validated), your age range, your profile picture (if you have one) and a link to your Google profile. If you log in or purchase a subscription using your Apple ID, you give Apple permission to share your personal information with us (however, you can choose to hide your email address and Apple will instead create a random email address so that your personal email can stay private). This email address will be linked to your account and allow you to access your subscribed content.

If you log into one of our Properties using a digital wallet, you give that wallet provider permission to share certain information with us, including public data points such as your wallet address, the blockchain your wallet is on, your wallet's transactions and transaction history, and whether the wallet holds a Forbes digital collectable.

We will use the information described above to form a profile for your account, to enable you to purchase a paid subscription, and/or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Statement. You have the option to later configure your Facebook, LinkedIn, or Google settings, or Apple ID to remove permissions for Forbes to access to this information. However, this will not affect our ability to use the information that we already received when you first set up your account (or purchased a subscription) using that social media login, so long as we use it for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Statement.

We may also obtain personal information of subscribers to Forbes licensees after such licensees stop conducting business under the Forbes license.

Because non-personal information does not personally identify you, we may collect, use, and disclose such information for any purpose permitted by law. In some instances, we may combine non-personal information with personal information. If we combine any non-personal information with personal information, the combined information will be treated by us as personal information.

The Properties may offer features that allow you to post content. You should be aware that personal information which you voluntarily include and transmit online in a publicly accessible blog, forum, social network, or otherwise online may be viewed and used by others. As a general reminder, please think carefully before you decide to put anything on the Internet. For example, if you voluntarily disclose personal information in chat areas or bulletin boards (e.g., comment sections), that information could be seen and used by others, and may result in unsolicited messages from others. We are not responsible for the information you may choose to submit in these public forums. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, please contact us using the information provided in the section titled Contacting Us. In some cases, for legal retention purposes or technical limitations (e.g., the data may not be searchable), we may not be able to remove personal information voluntarily disclosed by you in such forums, in which case, we will notify you.

With respect to how we use Service Data, we use that information to provide Services to our clients.<p>
